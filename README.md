# Cybersecurity Journey 🕵️‍♂️🔐  
Welcome to the one and only *Chronicles of a Cybersecurity Wannabe* (spoiler: future pro). This is where I document my epic (and sometimes painfully confusing) journey to becoming a cybersecurity expert. Think of this repo as my digital diary—but cooler.

## 📚 What's in Here?  
### 1. **Brain Dumps** (a.k.a Notes):  
- Networking: Learning how the internet doesn’t just “work like magic.”  
- Linux: Because Windows is for gamers, and Linux is for hackers (or so they say).  
- Cybersecurity Fundamentals: AKA, "What is the CIA triad, and why does it sound like a spy movie?"  
- More nerdy stuff I’ll explain as I figure it out.  

### 2. **Certifications**:  
My slow (but steady) crawl towards collecting badges of honor:  
- CompTIA Security+ (a.k.a Entry Ticket to Cyberland).  
- CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker—but no, I can’t hack your ex’s Instagram).  
- OSCP (the “big boy” cert, where I cry over hacking challenges).  

### 3. **Projects**:  
Where I pretend to be a pro by building tools like:  
- A custom port scanner (because scanning is cooler than knocking).  
- Scripts that make me go “wow, I actually wrote this?”  
- Malware analysis, because who doesn’t love dissecting virtual bad guys?

## 🛠️ How I’m Using This Repo:  
- **Notes**: Writing down everything I learn (so I don’t forget in two days).  
- **Progress Tracking**: Look at me being consistent! (Or not. Depends on caffeine levels.)  
- **Resources**: Cool stuff I found on the internet while procrastinating.  
- **Projects**: Proof that I actually know something (or am faking it really well).

## 🌟 Goals:  
1. Be the kind of hacker Hollywood movies make you believe exists.  
2. Build a portfolio so cool that recruiters double-take.  
3. Pass those certs without needing therapy afterward.

## 🎮 Practice Platforms:  
Where I spend my free time breaking stuff (legally, don’t call the cops):  
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) (My virtual playground).  
- [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) (Where I learn that I know nothing).  
- Random CTFs I find online.
